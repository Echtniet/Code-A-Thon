# Code-A-Thon
Problem:
A common problem almost everybody has in their lifetime is constantly applying to many jobs and having to deal with the 
frustrations of putting in the same information over twenty times and not getting direct contact with recruiters. Often, 
recruiters also have frustrations when looking for candidates because they can't seem to access the information they 
need to see if that person is the right fit for the job.

Solution:
What's the solution? JobRealm. A social media website that allows users to create either a job seeker profile or a recruiter 
profile. With JobRealm, job seekers are able to create a profile that allows them to enter all of their information only once 
and apply to countless jobs. This information includes a profile picture, contact information, a resume, cover letter, portfolio, 
and transcripts. Of course each section is optional. Job seekers are also able to search the recruiters' profiles to connect 
directly and share profiles to apply for jobs. Recruiters entering this realm have infinite access to all job seekers. 
Recruiters are able to seek out candidates and view profiles to get a full view of their resumes, cover letter, and portfolios. 
If recruiters are interested in a candidate they are able to ask to chat about a specific position. Another great feature for 
recruiters is the ability to easily go through profiles that have applied. When a seeker applies to a position the recruiter 
can either request a chat by starring the applicant or decline the applicant. All together an easier way to sift through 
multiple applicants.

KC-FED CODE-A-THON Theme:
So, how does this apply to the Code-A-Thon theme, well the theme is "Don't make me think!". How often do we have to think when
applying for a job or looking for a candidate? The answer is way too much. JobRealm has used a website, which everybody is aware
how to use, and created a frictionless experience for job seekers and job recruiters. This site autonomously connects, shares and 
interacts with consumers and other devices to enter a new realm of job seeking.
